<p>If you are confused this quick tutorial may help you out.</p>
<p>There are 5 links in the menu above, lets take a look at what each one does!</p>
<p><ol>
    <li>
        <img src="images/how1.jpg" alt="HOME" /><br />The <a href="#">Home</a> Button will bring you to this page. It's Purpose is only to display these instructions and provide a landing page for those who have just logged in. It also will display How many new messages you have.  (this is also displayed at the top right had corner of every page on this site.).<br /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <img src="images/how2.jpg" alt="JOBS" /><br />The <a href="index.php?act=01">Jobs</a> Button will bring you to a page that displays all the jobs you have contracted with us.  It will display both photography and websites.  You can view information like the price, the progress of the job, a link to preview it, deadlines, and much more.  For photography Jobs this is also where you will find a link to your edited photos.  <br /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <img src="images/how3.jpg" alt="INBOX" /><br />The <a href="index.php?act=inbox">Inbox</a> Button will bring you to a list of your messages. This is a place where you can contact the designer working on your project, and also receive messages from designers.<br /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <img src="images/how4.jpg" alt="LOGOUT" /><br />The <a href="index.php?act=logout">Logout</a> Button is fairly self-explanatory.  It will log you out of this website to keep your information private. If you do not logout you will remain logged in on this computer even after you close the window.<br /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <img src="images/how5.jpg" alt="ACCOUNT" /><br />The Account button at the top right will bring a drop down box that will allow you to change your password, or you can view your inbox. You may want to change your password because we often set a simple password as the default. <br /><br /><br />
    </li>
